Something is wrong here. Read the requirements then check the algorithms 
carefully and fix the problem:

REQUIREMENT: Write a Web-based application consisting of a Web form
(calc-tax.html) and a PHP program (calc-tax.php). The application should:
ask the user for a purchase amount; calculate the tax (7% or 0.07 
of the cost); calculate the total cost; display the purchase amount, tax, and 
total cost.

calc-tax.html algorithm:

	Prompt for purchaseAmount
	Get purchaseAmount
	Submit purchaseAmount to calc-Tax.php
END

calc-tax.php algorithm:

	Receive purchaseAmount from calc-tax.html
	tax = purchaseAmount * 0.07
	total = purchaseAmount + tax
	Display purchaseAmount, tax, total
END
